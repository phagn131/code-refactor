# üìñ Refactor a website to make it more accessible to viewers and readers, more efficent semantically in HTML and CSS, and include comments to facilitate developer readability.

* AS a marketing agency I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines 

## Acceptance Criteria

* GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards. 

* WHEN I view the source code

* THEN I find semantic HTML elements

* WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements

* THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

* WHEN I view the image elements

* THEN I find accessible alt attributes
 
* WHEN I view the heading attributes

* THEN they fall in sequential order

* WHEN I view the title element

* THEN I find a concise, descriptive title


## üìù Notes
